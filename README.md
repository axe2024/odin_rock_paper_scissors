# odin_rock_paper_scissors

This project aims to develop a rudimentary "rock, paper, scissors" game via java. The first iteration has the player playing against the pc in 5 rounds. The data will be reflected in the dev tools console.

As this first iteration is complete now, the most difficult part of this project was to have the game run iteratively whilst also keeping track of score. I was able to run the game 5 times through calling the playGame function 5x but this would not keep track of the score change. Each new instance of the game would simply refresh the whole activity. In the end, I needed to learn the "for" function to complete this project which has yet to be thoroughly taught in the curriculum at this point (though passed over quickly in the readings).
